    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Scientific sofTware Research for User experience, Design, Engagement, and
        Learning project <a href="#ref-1" class="ref-link">[1]</a> (STRUDEL) will create, using <em>user research</em>
        methodologies, a <em>typology</em> and <em>design system</em> for scientific
        software that will guide and support the development of highly functional and
        usable user interfaces.</p>
    <ul class="hanging-indent">
        <li><b>User research</b>.
        We are performing <em>user research</em> that will study artifacts,
            including software, user interfaces, and published literature;
            we are also conducting interviews with select project team members.
            From this qualitative data, we will identify the <em>characteristics of
            scientific software ecosystems</em>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Typology</b>.
        We will use the characteristics of scientific ecosystems to inform a
            <em>typology</em>, which includes scientific users' <em>work patterns</em>,
            onto which we will map existing software and projects.
        </li>

        <li><b>Design system</b>.
        By mapping project characteristics to typology categories, we will identify
            common patterns and construct abstract workflows that will be represented as
            <em>user interface (UI) flows</em> -- how a user progresses through a UI. To
            bring these UI flows directly to teams creating new interfaces, we will
            develop a <em>design system</em> that includes workflows, layouts, and
            components.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Project background</h2>
    <p>
        The user experience and sustainability of scientific software are pressing challenges that our community is working to address since this essential product impacts the production of knowledge and scientific progress. Scientific software often emerges to solve a specific need and evolves with the complex and iterative scientific inquiry and needs of a particular project or community. Unlike consumer and commercial software, the user experience and user interfaces are often an afterthought in the later stages of the projects. In tandem the sustainability and long-term impact of these products is inhibited when best practices and maintenance concerns are not on a team's radar or pushed into the background.  This may occur for many reasons, such as the users and user requirements not being clearly defined and evolving with the project, tight budget constraints and timelines, an inadequate number of RSEs from relevant backgrounds, or that the developers themselves are the primary users of the software and are focused on doing their research work.

        <p/>
        <p>
        To address these challenges, our team is developing a typology and design framework for scientific software, titled "Scientific software research for user experience, design, engagement and learning" (STRUDEL). The objective of the STRUDEL project is to support scientific software development by improving the user experience, software quality, and software sustainability. STRUDEL is developing a typology and design system to help project teams address some of the above mentioned challenges in the scientific environment by providing standard components and higher-level "flows" for scientific user interfaces that can be reused and customized.
