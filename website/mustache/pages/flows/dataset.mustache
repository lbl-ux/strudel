    	<h4>Intent of task flow:</h4>
    	<p>Dataset repository lists multiple(verified?) datasets uploaded by the community and available to the community which can be evaluated, downloaded and used for further science research.

		<h4>Do’s: </h4>
		<p>
			<ul>	
				<li>Support search and filtering of the data itself, not just dataset metadata</li>
				<li>Allow for inspection of the data prior to downloading. This can include:
					<ul style="padding-bottom: 0;">
						<li style="margin-left:1em">For observational data - showing what types of data was collected, over what period of time, and the observation count</li>
						<li style="margin-left:1em">Plots to describe characteristics of the data, such as gaps, quality </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Expect that there could be quite a lot of filtering options. Vertical sidebar filters can be useful for this, as well as “build your own” filters type patterns. </li>
				<li>If possible, allow users to filter within a specific dataset, so they don’t have to download an entire dataset that might not be relevant to their work. </li>
				<li>Data should always include units, so that it can be converted</li>


			</ul>
