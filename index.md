## Overview

The Scientific sofTware Research for User experience, Design, Engagement, and Learning project (STRUDEL) will create, using *user research* methodologies, a *typology* and *design system* for scientific software that will guide and support the development of highly functional and usable user interfaces.

**User research**.
We are performing *user research* that will study artifacts, including software, user interfaces, and published literature;
we are also conducting interviews with select project team members. 
From this qualitative data, we will identify the *characteristics of scientific software ecosystems*.

**Typology**. We will use the characteristics of scientific ecosystems to inform a *typology*, which includes scientific users' *work patterns*, onto which we will map existing software and projects. 

**Design system**. By mapping project characteristics to typology categories, we will identify common patterns and construct abstract workflows that will be represented as *user interface  (UI) flows* -- how a user progresses through a UI. To bring these UI flows directly to teams creating new interfaces, we will develop a *design system* that includes workflows, layouts, and components
